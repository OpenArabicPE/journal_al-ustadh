The transcription was provided by unknown human transcribers at <http://shamela.ws>. Imagery is available through <http://archive.alsharekh.org/> and it turned out that the page breaks recorded by shamela.ws did, in this case, correspond to the printed edition whose facsimiles could be found online.

This digital edition of ʿAbd Allāh Nadīm al-Idrīsī's weekly journal *al-Ustādh* (Cairo, 1892--1893) is part of and follows the principles of [Open Arabic Periodical Editions (OpenArabicPE)](https://openarabicpe.github.io) that were originally developped in the context of [Digital Muqtabas](https://github.com/tillgrallert/digital-muqtabas). Full text of this edition has been transcribed by the anonymous transcribers at [*al-maktaba al-shamela*](http://shamela.ws/index.php/book/35118). Digital imagery is available from [*arshīf al-majallāt ...*](http://archive.alsharekh.org/newmagazineYears.aspx?MID=106).

It appeared that the page breaks from *al-maktaba al-shamela* correspond to the printed copy. We have therefore added the relevant mark-up for page beginnings (`<pb ed="print" n="123"/>`) and an `<facsimile>` element containing links to the digital facsimiles at [*arshīf al-majallāt*](http://archive.alsharekh.org/). The boilerplate view, therefore, displays both facsimiles and the digital text. We have added publication dates for the first three volumes based on the physical copies at the Orient-Institut Beirut's library.
