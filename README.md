This digital edition of ʿAbd Allāh Nadīm al-Idrīsī's weekly journal *al-Ustādh* (Cairo, 1892--1893) is part of and follows the principles of [Open Arabic Periodical Editions (OpenArabicPE)](https://openarabicpe.github.io) that were originally developped in the context of [Digital Muqtabas](https://github.com/tillgrallert/digital-muqtabas). The full text of this edition has been transcribed by the anonymous transcribers at [*al-maktaba al-shamela*](http://shamela.ws/index.php/book/35118). Digital imagery is available from [*arshīf al-majallāt ...*][sakhrit] and [HathiTrust][hathitrust], which provides facsimiles of copies held at Harvard and Indiana University.

It appeared that the page breaks from *al-maktaba al-shamela* correspond to the printed copy. We have therefore added the relevant mark-up for page beginnings (`<pb ed="print" n="123"/>`) and an `<facsimile>` element containing links to the digital facsimiles at [*arshīf al-majallāt*][sakhrit]. The boilerplate view, therefore, displays both facsimiles and the digital text. We have added publication dates for the first three volumes based on the physical copies at the Orient-Institut Beirut's library.
